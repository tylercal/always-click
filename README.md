# Always Click
Automatically always click specified buttons on frequently visited pages.

## Overview
Configure a list of URLs prefixes and associated elements (defined via CSS selectors) that
you always want to click when a page loads. E.g. if you always use the "Sign in
with Google" button on VRBO, you would add a rule for `https://www.vrbo.com`
to look for the selector `btn#googleSocial`.
